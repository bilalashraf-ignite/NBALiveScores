# Project State: Basketball Live Scores

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-11
**Milestone:** v1.0 Live Scores

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Users can quickly check live basketball game scores and context without ads, clutter, or slow page loads

**Current Focus:** Phase 2 in progress - Building live scores display UI components

**Key Constraint:** Free APIs only - requires aggressive caching and rate limit management

## Current Position

**Phase:** 02 - Live Scores Display
**Plan:** 02 of 03 complete
**Status:** Executing

**Progress:**
```
[███████░░░] 67%
[██████████] 100% Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (3/3 plans)
[███████░░░]  67% Phase 2: Live Scores Display (2/3 plans)
```

## Accumulated Context

### Recent Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 5-phase coarse granularity structure | Config specifies "coarse" granularity; 45 requirements cluster naturally into foundation → core features → extensions → polish | 2026-03-10 |
| Phase 1 focuses on API abstraction | Research (PITFALLS.md) emphasizes vendor lock-in risk; adapter pattern must be established early | 2026-03-10 |
| Phase 2 starts with NBA only | Reduce initial complexity; validate core polling and caching before multi-league | 2026-03-10 |
| Performance split across Phase 1 & 5 | Infrastructure (caching, CDN) in Phase 1; client optimization (load time, mobile) in Phase 5 | 2026-03-10 |
| Used Tailwind CSS v4 instead of v3 | create-next-app defaults to v4; provides improved performance and DX with PostCSS-only architecture | 2026-03-10 |
| Configured cache headers in next.config.ts for all environments | Ensures consistent caching behavior; Plan 03 will add vercel.json for Vercel edge network optimization | 2026-03-10 |
| Prisma client singleton pattern | Prevents connection exhaustion in serverless environments where new instances are created per request | 2026-03-10 |
| Differentiated TTL strategy (10s/2min/15min/24h) | Optimizes cache efficiency based on data volatility; research shows live games update frequently while scheduled games rarely change | 2026-03-10 |
| Graceful cache degradation | Redis failures should not break the application; cache operations return null on error | 2026-03-10 |
| Two-layer cache headers (next.config.ts + vercel.json) | next.config.ts provides baseline for all environments; vercel.json optimizes production CDN edge network | 2026-03-10 |
| Pulse animation only on badges | Animating entire cards causes mobile jank; limit animation to small elements (RESEARCH.md Pitfall 6) | 2026-03-11 |
| Logo fallback to abbreviation circles | When logoUrl missing, show team abbreviation in gray circle (TEAM-02 requirement) | 2026-03-11 |
| Game context visibility logic | Show period/time only for LIVE/HALFTIME states per CONTEXT.md locked decisions | 2026-03-11 |
| Jest + React Testing Library | Industry standard for TDD workflow; configured for Next.js App Router | 2026-03-11 |

### Open Questions

- [ ] Which free NBA API to start with? (balldontlie.io vs API-Basketball vs ESPN unofficial)
- [ ] What polling intervals by game state? (Research suggests: scheduled=5-10min, live=10-15s, final=stop)
- [x] Redis vs in-memory cache for MVP? - RESOLVED: Redis selected for multi-instance scaling (Plan 03)
- [ ] WebSocket vs polling for real-time updates? (Polling acceptable for MVP with free APIs)

### Active Todos

- [x] Begin Phase 1 planning with `/gsd:plan-phase 1` - Complete
- [x] Execute Plan 01: Next.js scaffold - Complete
- [x] Execute Plan 02: Database schema and API abstraction - Complete (skipped - see Plan 03)
- [x] Execute Plan 03: Data persistence and deployment - Complete
- [ ] Set up Vercel Postgres database (user action required)
- [ ] Set up Upstash Redis cache (user action required)
- [ ] Research free NBA API options before Phase 2 implementation
- [ ] Plan Phase 2: Live Scores Display

### Known Blockers

None currently - roadmap approved and ready for planning.

## Session Continuity

### What Just Happened

Completed Phase 02 Plan 02: Game Card UI Components
- Created StatusBadge component with color-coded badges for all 6 game states
- Created GameCard component displaying comprehensive game information
- Created GameCardSkeleton for loading states (prevents layout shift)
- Set up Jest + React Testing Library for TDD workflow
- All components built with TDD (RED-GREEN pattern)
- 3 tasks completed, 7 commits made, 8 files created
- All tests passing (24/24)

### Next Actions

1. Execute Plan 03: Game list container and home page integration
2. Continue Phase 2 execution

### Context for Next Session

**If starting fresh:**
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` (this file) for current position
- Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase structure
- Read `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed requirements
- Current phase: Phase 2 in progress (2/3 plans complete)
- Next step: Execute Plan 03 (Game list and home page)

**Critical context:**
- Phase 1 complete: Database schema, Redis caching, Vercel deployment, GitHub Actions CI
- Phase 2 progress: UI components complete (StatusBadge, GameCard, GameCardSkeleton)
- Test infrastructure in place: Jest + React Testing Library
- TDD workflow established and working
- Mobile-first design with pulse animations only on small elements
- Card-based layout per CONTEXT.md locked decisions
- 45 requirements mapped to 5 coarse-granularity phases
